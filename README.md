# CarManagementProject

The purpose of this document is to outline the individual project specification that you will be working on during the training. This project will involve concepts from all core training modules; more specifically, this will involve:

    Agile & Project Management
    Databases & Cloud Fundamentals
    Java SE/EE
    Front-End Development
    Automated Testing

The individual project can be on any subject you deem fit of encapsulating all aspects of the aforementioned modules. This could be a business case, such as a library or supermarket system, or something to do with a hobby of yours â€“ as long as the application is CRUD functional.

This is purposefully open as we want to endorse creativity and give you an opportunity to do a project that you have full command over.

Your front-end and back-end must be linked together and fully functional, please bear this in mind when organising your time. 



** The overall objective of the project is the following:**

    To create an OOP-based application with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training.

More specifically, you are required to create a full-stack web application following the enterprise architecture model:

    An application back-end developed using Java (Spring Boot framework).
    A test suite utilising JUnit and Mockito for integration and unit tests of the back-end as well as Selenium for automated front-end tests
    A managed MySQL database hosted locally or within a cloud provider examined during Cloud Fundamentals module.
    A front-end developed using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

If you wish to use any technologies which have not been covered with the training, you must consult with your trainer first.

You must plan the approach you will take to complete this project using project management and design technologies you have learnt.
